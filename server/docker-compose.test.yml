    # --- Key Differences ---
    # 1. We override the command to run your test script
    #    (Assumes "bun test" is in your package.json)
    command: bun test
    
    # 2. We load the .env.test file
    env_file:
      - ./.env.test
    
    # 3. We depend on the 'db-test' service
    depends_on:
      - db-test

  # A separate, isolated database just for this test run
  db-test:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: my-app-db-test
    
    # We don't need to expose ports, it's all internal
    
    # 4. Environment variables MUST match your .env.test file
